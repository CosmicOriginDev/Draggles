Upgrading
Upgrade canisters spawn randomly inside buildings throughout your maps.
Use Draggles to rip and tear buildings to shreds to find upgrade canisters.
HINT: If you are near an upgrade, Draggles will put its tail up.
If you find an upgrade canister, walk Draggles near it and it will automatically put it in storage.
You need to use the lab to install upgrades. Press options to enter the lab.
HINT: Some upgrades spawn in alternate dimensions...

Reloading Fuel/Ammo
Draggles' ammunition are synthesized from hydrocarbons such as propane. Draggles can consume fuel and convert it into ammunition.
Simply walk near a fuel source and Draggles will automatically consume it.

Soaring Mode
Draggles is capable of flying at high altitudes for hundreds of miles.
If you keep flying up, Draggles will switch into soaring mode, allowing you to travel to a variety of locations around Lockelle!

Alternate Dimensions
The lab has a newly constructed room at the end of the main hallway.
There are two teleporters. They will take you to alternate worlds. (There is only one so far,,,)
The one with the hammer will take you back to your world.
The other one, well... We have limited information about what is on the other side.
The science team we sent down there hasn't returned yet and the pictures they sent us were very strange...
There are no people... Only robots. In some of the pictures we saw something lurking in the shadows.
But, we are sure Draggles will be able to protect you if you venture down there...
